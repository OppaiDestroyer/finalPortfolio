    "title": "Pooms-E: Taekwondo Poomsae Judge Robot using Deep Learning",
    "description": "Pooms-E is a deep learning-powered robot designed to evaluate Taekwondo poomsae performances. This system automates the judging process, providing competitors with objective scores through a user-friendly web application. The robot is built around a Raspberry Pi main processing unit, which is enhanced with a Hailo AI accelerator to ensure smooth and efficient AI inference. A Camera Module 3 records the poomsae performances, while an ATmega328p microcontroller handles the arm movements. For the AI component, Pooms-E utilizes a YOLO object detection and pose estimation model to analyze the movements of the competitors. This model was trained and optimized for performance using the Degirum framework, which streamlines the post-processing steps. Despite limited computing resources, the system achieved a respectable 88% accuracy in its evaluations. The robot's scores are delivered to users via a web application built with Python Flask, allowing for easy connection and real-time viewing of results. This project successfully defended its thesis, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to bring a new level of precision to sports judging.",
